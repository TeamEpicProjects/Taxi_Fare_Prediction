# Taxi Fare Prediction


![GitHub last commit](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/TeamEpicProjects/Taxi_Fare_Prediction)

NYC Taxi is one of the cab services in New York, which is growing rapidly online car rental and taxi hire companies in New York. To keep up the pace at which they are growing they have decided to optimize their pricing to gain a good customer base and stay competitive. This project is aimed at predicting the optimized and thus competitive fare price depending on several factors like time , day of the week, peak hours, etc. Other factors to consider are distance, weather, availability of cabs, etc. If the car is rented for >1 day, then the fare should be calculated accordingly.
We also find insights about the taxi bookings, their pickup/drop locations, times to understand our user behaviour.
