## Business Insights
- Write all the findings and benefit (profit/optimization of something)
- E.g. The heatmap of pickup and drop locations shows that the taxi demand is highly concentrated at certain regions.  
    And thus, deploying more taxis or increasing the prices during high demand periods could bring more profit to the company.
